# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a mini machine learning application that detects fraudulent credit card transactions using classification algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The model is trained on a real-world, imbalanced dataset and evaluated using various performance metrics.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Aim

To detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data using supervised machine learning techniques, with focus on both performance and handling class imbalance.

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest (with Hyperparameter Tuning via GridSearchCV)

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

- `ML(Credit Card Fraud Detection).ipynb` â€“ Main Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab ready)
- `creditcard.csv` â€“ Dataset (from Kaggle)

---

## ðŸ“Š Features Implemented

- ðŸ“Œ Data Preprocessing (scaling with RobustScaler)
- ðŸ“Œ Class imbalance handling via under-sampling
- ðŸ“Œ Model training & testing
